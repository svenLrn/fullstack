    <h2>Cats</h2>
    <p>
      Millions of people in the world own a pet, which can also be referred to as a domesticated animal    because they live in a person's home and not in the wilderness, and they are trained. It could be a cat, dog, hamster, gerbil, turtle, snake, fish, bird, pig, or many other kinds of animals.
      <br>
      The most common pet in America is the cat. A cat is also called a feline, its official scientific name. Cats have been in the world for a long time and first became domesticated (tamed) over 4,000 years ago in Ancient Egypt. The Ancient Egyptians used cats to protect their food from pests. The cat had a place of honor, was admired as a hunter, and was worshipped as a god or goddess by the Egyptians. The cat was so important to them if a person killed a cat they could receive the death penalty. Cats that died were also mummified (bodies preserved) before they were buried.
      <br>
      As time passed, the cat became more domesticated and tamed and other civilizations began to own them. They first became popular in Italy and then slowly spread throughout Europe. When people from England came to settle in America, they also brought cats with them as pets. The cat also spread throughout India, China, and Japan. International Cat Day is celebrated throughout the world every October 29th.
      <br>
      Cats have always been popular household pets, though, for a short time, cats were associated with the devil. However, by the 1700s, cats were popular throughout the entire world. Today, there are more than 500 million cats living in the world.
